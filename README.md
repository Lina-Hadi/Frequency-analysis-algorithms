# Frequency Cryptanalysis Tool - Streamlit App

Welcome to our cryptanalysis application for classical ciphers!

This interactive tool was designed to help decrypt texts encrypted with monoalphabetic (Caesar) and polyalphabetic (Vigen√®re) methods. It applies statistical analysis, including:

- Index of Coincidence (IC),
- Frequency Analysis (Chi¬≤),
- Key Length Detection,
- Automatic Ciphertext Decryption.

---

## üí° Features

- Graphical interface using **Streamlit**.
- Supports encrypted text with or without spaces.
- Automatic key detection using Index of Coincidence.
- Smart key reduction to avoid repeated patterns (e.g., "VIGENEREVIGENERE" ‚û°Ô∏è "VIGENERE").
- Clear result display for easy interpretation.

---

## üß† How to Use

1. **Run the application**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. **Input Encrypted Text**

Copy/paste your ciphertext into the input area labeled "Enter your encrypted text".

3. **Click "Analyze Text"**

- The key will be automatically estimated.
- The ciphertext will be decrypted.
- Results will be displayed in the interface.
